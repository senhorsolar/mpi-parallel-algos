# MPI Parallel Algorithms

This repo contains examples of parallel algorithms using MPI. Examples include:
* Prefix sum
* Sorting
* Matrix multiplication
* Communication primitives

These examples are for educational purposes. The work here is essentially a brain-dump of a class I took on parallel algorithms.

The makefile was modeled after https://github.com/JeffBezanson/numal/blob/master/Makefile.

### TODO

- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Add iterative methods (Jacobi, Newton's method, etc.)
