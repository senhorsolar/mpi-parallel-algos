Contained here are examples of popular communication primitives such as reduce, all-to-all, etc. Most if not all of these communication primitives are already provided by MPI, and are implemented here for educational purposes. 

Primitives include:
* Broadcast
* Reduce (just for double types)
* Scan (just for double types)
* Gather (all gather)
* Scatter
* All-to-all
